# ML Bootcamp Week-4 Day-2💻👤
## 😉 Pokemon Classification Project 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify Pokemon images into three categories: Pikachu ⚡️, Bulbasaur 🍃, and Charmander 🔥. By training a deep learning model on a labeled dataset of Pokemon images, the system can predict the correct category for a given input image.

### ➤ Project Overview 📚
* The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing and classifying Pokémon images into three categories: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander.
*  We will utilize a deep neural network architecture, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to learn and extract relevant features from Pokémon images.
*The model will be trained on a carefully curated dataset consisting of labeled images of Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, ensuring a diverse range of poses, angles, and environments.
* Data augmentation techniques, such as image rotation, flipping, and zooming, will be applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize and handle variations in the input data.
* The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess its classification capabilities.

🌟 Let's catch 'em all and classify them with precision! Have a fantastic time exploring the world of Pokémon and building an incredible classification system! 🌟
## LET'S SEE HOW THEY LOOK!!
